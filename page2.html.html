The Midgard Serpent also is known as Jormungand, the Midgard serpent is the child of Loki. it was Odin who threw him into the sea. But the Midgard serpent loved the ocean, and it started to grow tremendously large. And within a short time had the Midgard Serpent grown so huge it encircled all the land. The Midgard Serpent was feared by human and also the Gods. Thor and the Midgard serpent are arch enemies. They will kill each other at Ragnarok.</li>

<li>Nidhogg-(Old Norse Níðhöggr, literally “Curse-striker” or “He Who Strikes with Malice”) is the foremost of several serpents or dragons who dwell beneath the world-tree Yggdrasil and eat its roots. This is highly injurious to the tree, which holds the Nine Worlds of the cosmos.[1] Nidhogg’s actions have the intention of pulling the cosmos back to chaos, and he, along with his reptilian cohort, can therefore surely be classified among the giants (or, as they were called in pre-Christian times, “devourers”).</li>
