<p style="color:darkorchid; font-size: 30px;">There are nine worlds in Norse Mythology, they are called Niflheim, Muspelheim, Asgard, Midgard, Jotunheim, Vanaheim, Alfheim, Svartalfheim, Helheim. The nine worlds in Norse mythology are held in the branches and roots of the world tree Yggdrasil. These realms are the home of different kind of beings, like the home of the Gods and Goddesses or giants.<br>
Valhalla (Old Norse Valhöll) is located in Asgard, the front of the big city of Asgard there are 540 doors. The doors are so wide that through each huge door, 800 warriors can walk side by side. The roof is covered with golden shields, and the walls around Valhalla are made from wooden spear shafts. This is the place where half of the Vikings who had died in a battle would come for their afterlife.The other half of the Vikings are given to the Goddess Freya; she always has the first choice from every dead warrior. Each and every morning the Vikings in Valhalla will take their weapons and put on their armor and then walk out to the big plains in Asgard and fight.<br>
 It did not matter if they got their arms, legs or head cut off. Because when the great dinner in the evening came they would all be restored to normal. In the evening they will return home to Valhalla and sit down and eat and drink. When the cook Andhrimnir cut steaks from the side of the pig Saehrimnir “A giant pig” this is not a normal pig but a magical pig. it will grow back immediately. There is also a goat named Heidrun, it’s standing on the roof of Valhalla, and eats from the branches of the tree of life Yggdrasil. While from its udder floats a lot of mead, down to a huge tub, big enough to make everyone in Valhalla drunk every day. The Valkyries will serve the Vikings, pork, and mead.<br>

In the middle of Asgard, where the Gods and Goddesses lives, is Yggdrasil. Yggdrasil is the tree of life, and it is an eternal green Ash tree; the branches stretch out over all of the nine worlds in Norse mythology, and extend up and above the heavens. Yggdrasil is carried by three enormous roots, the first root from Yggdrasil is in Asgard, the home of the Gods it is just next to the well-named Urd, this is where the Gods and Goddesses have their daily meetings. The second root from Yggdrasil goes all the way down to Jotunheim, the land of the giants, next to this root is Mimir’s well. The third root from Yggdrasil goes down to Niflheim, close to the well Hvergelmir. It is here the dragon Nidhug is chewing on one of Yggdrasil’s roots. Nidhug is also known to suck the blood out of the dead bodies, that arrives at Hel. At the very top of Yggdrasil lives an eagle, the eagle and the dragon Nidhug are bitter enemies, they truly despise each other. There is a squirrel named Ratatosk, and he spending almost the entire day, by running up and down the ash tree. Ratatosk does whatever he can, to keep the hatred between the eagle and the dragon alive. Every time Nidhug says a curse or an insult about the eagle, Ratatosk will run up to the top of the tree, and tell the eagle what Nidhug just said. The eagle is equally rude in his comments about Nidhug. Ratatosk just loves to gossip which is the reason why the eagle and the dragon remain constant foes.<br>
