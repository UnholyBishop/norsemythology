<p style="color:darkorchid;font-style:oblique;font-size: 30px;">Norse mythology is an incredibly rich and deep lore, full of many great stories and poems of the Nordic culture, from Scandinavia and the Germanic countries. Norse mythology which is also known as Germanic mythology is a not just a myth, it is a religion and it was practiced by the Vikings who lived in the Scandinavian countries in the Viking age, but it was also practiced by the Germanic people. What the Vikings called their religion or if it even had a name like other religions has, no one knows<br> In the last few decades, the sagas from Norse mythology and the culture of the Vikings have increasingly spread across the world. Many people have even been inspired in the late 20th century, and references to Norse mythology became more common in literature and in movies such as lord of the rings, The 13th warrior and in series such as The Vikings. In culture has even spread into the gaming industry there has also been many games, one of them which is among my favorite is a role-playing game called Skyrim, which clearly has a Nordic touch. One of my favorite cartoons from 1986 called Valhalla, always brings me back happy memories from when I was a child. Which is a cartoon I clearly can recommend and it is fun for both children and adults.<br> Norse mythology is polytheistic which means worshiping in multiple Gods and Goddesses. The Vikings believed that there are two branches of Gods the Æsir and the Vanir but they also believed in other mythical beings such as giants, dwarfs, and other creatures. You may have heard some of the Gods or Goddesses before…<br> Odin who is the chief of the Aesir, married with Frigg who is the Queen of Asgard. Or what about Thor the God of thunder and the protector of Midgard the world of man! And who can forget about Loki… ahhh Loki so many great stories about him, always up to some new tricks to annoy the Aesir. And there are many many more.<br>
